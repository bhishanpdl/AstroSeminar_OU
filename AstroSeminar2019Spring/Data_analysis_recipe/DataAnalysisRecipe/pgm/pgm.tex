\begin{abstract}
We present an introduction to probabilistic graphical models (PGMs;
also sometimes called ``directed acyclic graphs'') in the context of
building models of scientific data sets.  We focus on their use as a
conceptual tool, helping to clarify and express complicated
probabilistic expressions or really assumptions about complex,
hierarchical probability distributons.  PGMs are most useful for
describing generative models, in that they can be used to both
describe the probability expressions for those models, but also the
causal relationships that are being assumed (or inferred).  PGMs, in
themselves, do not perform or speed calculations; they also aren't, in
themselves, methods; they act to express unambiguously probabilistic
and causal relationships.
