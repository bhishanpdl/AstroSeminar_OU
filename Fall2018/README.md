# Some Questions
1. Why to assemble multiple Radio Telescopes when there are already large telescopes (>200m) ?

> The required telescopes must be millimeter telescopes.

2. What is approx size of horizon scale diameter
> 10 micro arcsecond

3. Why they look Milky Way and M87 not Andromeda (M31) ?
> Andromeda nucleus black hole does not have strong radio emissions.

4. What is difference between environment of Solar System and around Black Hole?
> The gravity is massive around Black Hole.

5. In the predicted image of BH horizon, why there is assymetry?
> Strong Lensing, relativistic beaming.

6. What causes radio emission?
> Earth radiates at infra-red. Sun radiates at optical range. Radio active galaxies emits radio emissions.
  Active supermassive black holes are also however often associated with strong emission in the radio.
  The energetic electrons accelerated by the black hole spirals around magnetic field lines.
  This produce SYNCHROTON radio emission.
  
7. What is Kerr metric
> The Kerr metric is a generalization of the Schwarzschild metric, discovered by Karl Schwarzschild in 1915, which described the geometry of spacetime around an uncharged, spherically-symmetric, and non-rotating body.

|                    | Non-rotating (J = 0)  | Rotating (J ≠ 0) |
|---                 |---                    |---               |
| Uncharged (Q = 0)  |  Schwarzschild        |  Kerr            |  
| Charged (Q ≠ 0)    | Reissner–Nordstrom    |  Kerr–Newman     |
